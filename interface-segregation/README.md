## Interface segregation principle

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) requires you to break down large interfaces into smaller, more specialized interfaces.

This helps classes only need to implement the methods they really need and not have to implement unrelated methods.

Applying ISP makes code easy to maintain, easy to extend, and reduces unnecessary dependencies.
