## Dependency Inversion Principle

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) encourages high-level and low-level modules to depend on abstractions (interfaces) instead of concrete details.

Applying DIP makes code easier to extend, reduces dependencies between modules, and increases application flexibility.

This allows you to replace or extend components in the system without affecting other parts.
