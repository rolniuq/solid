## Single responsibility

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) requires that each class should have only one responsibility.

Applying SRP makes code easier to maintain, easier to extend, and reduces the risk of errors arising from unrelated changes within the same class.

Breaking down layers according to specific responsibilities helps the system become more flexible and easier to develop in the future.
